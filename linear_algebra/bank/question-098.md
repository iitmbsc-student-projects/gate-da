- If $\displaystyle k=0$, the system has exactly one solution, with $\displaystyle x=1,y=-1$. 

- If $\displaystyle k\neq 0$, then the system will have a unique solution if $\displaystyle \frac{1}{k} \neq \frac{k}{1} \Longrightarrow k^{2} \neq 1\Longrightarrow k\neq \pm 1$. So the system has a unique solution whenever $\displaystyle k=0$ or $\displaystyle k\neq \pm 1$. 

- The system has infinitely many solutions when $\displaystyle \frac{1}{k} =\frac{k}{1} =-1$. This happens when $\displaystyle k=-1$.

- The system has no solution when $\displaystyle \frac{1}{k} =\frac{k}{1} \neq -1$. This happens when $\displaystyle k=1$.
