A rectangle has length $L$ and width $W$, where $L > W$. If the width, $W$, is increased by $10\%$, which one of the following statements is correct for all values of $L$ and $W$?

- [ ] Perimeter increases by $10\%$.
- [ ] Length of the diagonals increases by $10\%$.
- [ ] Area increases by $10\%$.
- [ ] The rectangle becomes a square

We see that the percentage change in area is:

$$
\frac{1.1LW-LW}{LW} \times 100=10\%
$$

This is independent of $L$ and $W$.
