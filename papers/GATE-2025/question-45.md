A random experiment consists of throwing $100$ fair dice, each having six faces numbered $1$ to $6$. An event $A$ represents the set of all outcomes where at least one of the dice shows a $1$. Then, $P( A) =$

 - [ ] $0$

 - [ ] $1$

 - [ ] $1-\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$

 - [ ] $\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$

 - [ ] $0$

 - [ ] $1$

 - [x] $1-\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$

 - [ ] $\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$

The event $A^{c}$ is the one where none of the dice shows a $1$. For a single dice to not show a $1$, the probability is $\cfrac{5}{6}$. Assuming independence, the probability of none of the dice showing a $1$ is $P\left( A^{c}\right) =\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$. It follows that $P( A) =1-\left(\cfrac{5}{6}\right)^{100}$.
