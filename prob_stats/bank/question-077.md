When six unbiased dice are rolled simultaneously, the probability of getting all
distinct numbers (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) is

- [ ] $\cfrac{1}{324}$

- [ ] $\cfrac{5}{324}$

- [ ] $\cfrac{7}{324}$

- [ ] $\cfrac{11}{324}$

- [x] $\cfrac{5}{324}$

- [ ] $\cfrac{7}{324}$

- [ ] $\cfrac{11}{324}$

When six dice are rolled simultaneously, we start by assuming that all possible combinations are equally likely. Now, for all six rolls to be distinct, the numbers $\displaystyle 1$ to $\displaystyle 6$ must occur exactly once. This can happen in $\displaystyle 6!$ ways. The total number of outcomes in the sample space is $\displaystyle 6^{6}$. Therefore, the required probability is $\displaystyle \frac{6!}{6^{6}} =\frac{5}{324}$.
