In a manufacturing company, each machine produces 600 bottles daily. If a bottle is selected uniformly at random, then the probability that the bottle is of good quality is $60\%$. Using the Central Limit Theorem, find the approximate probability that a machine will produce more than 370 bottles that are of good quality on a particular day.  Write your answer upto 2 decimal places.
