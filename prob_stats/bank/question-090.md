A research team is analyzing customer complaints per day for a new service. The number of complaints $X$ follows a Poisson distribution with an unknown average rate $\lambda$. The number of complaints observed over a period of 10 days are as follows:

$$
3,\ 5,\ 2,\ 4,\ 6,\ 3,\ 4,\ 7,\ 5,\ 4
$$

Find the maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda$. Enter your answer correct to one decimal place.

$4.3$

The MLE of $\lambda$ for a Poisson distribution is the sample average. Therefore, $\hat{\lambda} =( 3+5+2+4+6+3+4+7+5+4) /10=4.3$.
