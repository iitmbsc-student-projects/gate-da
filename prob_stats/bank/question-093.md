Let $X$ be a random variable such that $P(X = 1) = k, P(X = 2) = 2k, P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = k^2, P(X = 5) = 2k^2$.
What is the value of $P(1<X<4 \hspace{0.5mm}|\hspace{0.5mm} X>2)$? Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places.

Find the value of $k$ by using the property of being valid PMF which is $\sum_{i=1}^{n}P(X = x_i) = 1$.
