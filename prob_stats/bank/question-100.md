There are two coins in a bag where one coin is fair (H and T are equally likely), and the other is biased with a 75\% chance of landing on heads (H) and a 25\% chance of landing on tails (T). Suppose you select one coin from the bag and toss it. Assume that the coin selection is random and equally likely. 
If the selected coin lands on head, what is the probability that the coin is fair? Enter the answer correct to one decimal place.
