    "text": "Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be two real valued functions such that \\(g(x) = f(x) - 2\\). Select all true options.\n\nIf \\(f\\) is odd, then \\(g\\) is odd.\nIf \\(f\\) is even, then \\(g\\) is even.\nIf \\(g\\) is odd, then \\(f\\) is odd.\nIf \\(g\\) is even, then \\(f\\) is even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn odd function is one that satisfies \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nAn even function is one that satisfies \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f\\) is odd, then \\(g\\) is odd.\nIf \\(f\\) is even, then \\(g\\) is even.\nIf \\(g\\) is odd, then \\(f\\) is odd.\nIf \\(g\\) is even, then \\(f\\) is even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f\\) is odd, then \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\). Then: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(-x) &= f(-x) - 2\\\\\n&= -f(x) - 2\\\\\n&= -[f(x) + 2]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This doesn’t allow us to conclude anything about the nature of \\(g\\). A simple counter-example will show that if \\(f\\) is odd, \\(g\\) need not be odd. For instance, if \\(f(x)= x\\), we have \\(g(x) = x - 2\\), which is neither odd nor even.\nIf \\(f\\) is even, then \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\). Then: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(-x) &= f(-x) - 2\\\\\n&= f(x) - 2\\\\\n&= g(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Therefore, if \\(f\\) is even, then \\(g\\) is also even. A similar argument holds for the case when \\(g\\) is even.",

The value of \\(\\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{5} \\sigma_i\\) is ________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(55\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful results:\n\nA matrix \\(A\\) of rank \\(r\\) has \\(r\\) positive singular values.\nThe first \\(r\\) eigenvalues of \\(A^TA\\) are the squares of the first \\(r\\) singular values.\nA matrix of the form \\(u u^T\\) is unit rank.\n\\((||u||^2, u)\\) is an eigenpair of \\(uu^T\\). In fact, \\(||u||^2\\) is the only eigenvalue for this matrix.\nIf \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\), \\(n\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(nA\\).\n\nWith these results, we see that \\(M\\) has exactly one non-zero singular value, namely \\(\\sigma_1\\), assuming it is the largest of the lot. The rest are zero. The largest eigenvalue of \\(M^TM\\) is therefore \\(\\sigma_1^2\\). Since \\(M = uu^T\\), \\(M^TM = ||u||^2 M\\). From the RHS, we gather that the largest singular value of \\(M^TM\\) is \\(||u||^4\\). This leads us to: \\[\n\\sigma_1^2 = ||u||^4 \\implies \\sigma_1 = ||u||^2\n\\] Since \\(||u||^2 = 55\\), \\(\\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{5} \\sigma_i = 55\\).",
