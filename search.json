    "text": "What is the product of the non-zero eigenvalues of the following matrix: \\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(6\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its determinant. But the determinant of this matrix is zero and we are asked to compute the product of the non-zero eigenvalues. We should therefore take recourse to the characteristic polynomial: \\[\nD = \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] Though this determinant looks forbidding, computing it is not all that cumbersome if we choose the right row/column along which to expand. Let us first break this down into the following sum by expanding along the first row: \\[\nD = (1 - \\lambda) \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] The two determinants look quite similar to each other. We can expand along the last row for both of them: \\[\nD = \\left[(1 - \\lambda)^2 - 1 \\right] \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] Let us first compute the \\(3 \\times 3\\) determinant: \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n\\end{vmatrix} = - \\lambda^2 (\\lambda - 3)\n\\] Putting it all together: \\[\nD = -\\lambda^3(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda - 3)\n\\] We see that there are five eigenvalues: \\(0, 0, 0, 2, 3\\). The product of the non-zero eigenvalues is therefore \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
