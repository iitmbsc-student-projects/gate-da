To see why note that we can view matrix multiplication in the following way. If \\(B = \\begin{bmatrix}b_1 & \\cdots & b_n\\end{bmatrix}\\) has \\(n\\) columns, then \\(AB\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix}\nAb_1 & \\cdots & Ab_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\] We see that the \\(i^{th}\\) column of \\(AB\\) is a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\), with the multipliers coming from the \\(i^{th}\\) column of \\(b\\). Thus the column space of \\(AB\\) is a subspace of the column space of \\(A\\). It follows that \\(\\text{rank}(AB) \\leqslant \\text{rank}(A)\\).\nWe could also view matrix multiplication in another way. If \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix}r_1^T\\\\\\vdots\\\\r_m^T\\end{bmatrix}\\) has \\(m\\) rows, then \\(AB\\) can be written as: \\[\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix}\nr_1^TB\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\nr_m^TB\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\] We see that the \\(i^{th}\\) row of \\(AB\\) is a linear combination of the rows of \\(B\\), with the multipliers coming form the \\(i^{th}\\) row of \\(A\\). Thus the row space of \\(AB\\) is a subspace of the row space of \\(B\\). It follows that \\(\\text{rank}(AB) \\leqslant \\text{rank}(B)\\).\nCombining the two inequalities, we have: \\[\n\\text{rank}(AB) \\leqslant \\min(\\text{rank}(A), \\text{rank}(B))\n\\]\nThus if we start with a matrix \\(A\\) and multiply it by some matrix \\(B\\), the rank of the resulting matrix cannot be more than the rank of \\(A\\).",

We have shown that skew-symmetric matrices of odd order are not invertible. For \\(\\displaystyle n\\) being even, the above equation won’t allow us to conclude anything. Therefore, we have to deal in (counter) examples.\nConsider the following counter examples:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} ,\\ B=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} ,\\ C=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0\\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nAll three matrices are skew-symmetric of even order. \\(\\displaystyle A\\) is invertible, while \\(\\displaystyle B\\) and \\(\\displaystyle C\\) are not. \\(\\displaystyle C\\) has been included as \\(\\displaystyle B\\) is quite trivial. If a skew-symmetric matrix is of even order, we can’t comment on its invertibility without more information.",

In BCNF, every non-trivial functional dependency \\(x \\rightarrow y\\) implies \\(x\\) is a super key. For relations with two attributes, all non-trivial functional dependencies would indeed have the left side (\\(x\\)) as a super key.\nIf all attributes of a relation are prime attributes, then the relation is in BCNF: False. It’s possible for prime attributes to determine each other, which is allowed in 3NF but not in BCNF.\nEvery relation has at least one non-prime attribute: False. It’s not mandatory for a relation to have at least one non-prime attribute. However, every relation has at least one prime attribute.\nBCNF decompositions preserve functional dependencies: False. BCNF decompositions might lose some functional dependencies, as exemplified by the case where \\(D \\rightarrow A\\) in a relation \\([AB \\rightarrow CD, D \\rightarrow A]\\) where \\(D\\) is not a super key, and it’s not in BCNF.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that holds true is (a) - a relation with only two attributes is always in BCNF.",

For a symmetric matrix (a diagonalizable matrix, to be more specific), the rank is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues (including the multiplicity). Therefore \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are the only non-zero eigenvalues and each of them occurs just once. The required product is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).\n\n\nThe product of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its determinant. But the determinant of this matrix is zero and we are asked to compute the product of the non-zero eigenvalues. We should therefore take recourse to the characteristic polynomial: \\[\nD = \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] Though this determinant looks forbidding, computing it is not all that cumbersome if we choose the right row/column along which to expand. Let us first break this down into the following sum by expanding along the first row: \\[\nD = (1 - \\lambda) \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] The two determinants look quite similar to each other. We can expand along the last row for both of them: \\[\nD = \\left[(1 - \\lambda)^2 - 1 \\right] \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\] Let us first compute the \\(3 \\times 3\\) determinant: \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 - \\lambda & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 - \\lambda\\\\\n\\end{vmatrix} = - \\lambda^2 (\\lambda - 3)\n\\] Putting it all together: \\[\nD = -\\lambda^3(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda - 3)\n\\] We see that there are five eigenvalues: \\(0, 0, 0, 2, 3\\). The product of the non-zero eigenvalues is therefore \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Therefore, \\(\\displaystyle A^{2}\\) is also positive definite.\nSince \\(\\displaystyle A\\) has \\(\\displaystyle n\\) positive eigenvalues, its rank is \\(\\displaystyle n\\) and it is invertible. Pre-multiplying both sides by \\(A^{-1}\\) and dividing both sides by \\(\\lambda_i\\) (we can do this since \\(\\lambda_i &gt; 0\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\nAv_{i} & =\\lambda v_{i}\\\\\nA^{-1} v_{i} & =\\frac{1}{\\lambda _{i}} v_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nWe see that \\(\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda _{i}} ,v_{i}\\right)\\) is an eigenpair of \\(\\displaystyle A^{-1}\\).

Besides its elegance, it is notable for the marriage of multiple ideas: different ways of multiplying matrices, linking inner products, outer producs and the trace.\n\nLet \\(\\displaystyle A\\) be an \\(\\displaystyle m\\times n\\) matrix and \\(\\displaystyle B\\) be an \\(\\displaystyle n\\times m\\) matrix. We can represent \\(\\displaystyle A\\) and \\(\\displaystyle B\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}\n| &  & |\\\\\na_{1} & \\cdots  & a_{n}\\\\\n| &  & |\n\\end{bmatrix} ,\\ B=\\begin{bmatrix}\n- & b_{1}^{T} & -\\\\\n&  & \\\\\n- & b_{n}^{T} & -\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\displaystyle a_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and \\(\\displaystyle b_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).

We need to see if there is a possibility for this. Therefore, consider:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ng( x) =\\frac{x}{\\left( x^{2} +3\\right)^{2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nWe notice that \\(\\displaystyle g( x)\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(\\displaystyle x\\rightarrow \\pm \\infty\\). This shows that the x-axis is an asymptote to \\(\\displaystyle g\\). We also note that \\(\\displaystyle g( x) &lt; 0\\) for \\(\\displaystyle x&lt; 0\\) and \\(\\displaystyle g( x)  &gt;0\\) for \\(\\displaystyle x &gt;0\\). Let us try to understand \\(\\displaystyle g\\) better using its first derivative:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\ng^{\\prime }( x) & =\\frac{\\left( x^{2} +3\\right)^{2} -4x^{2}\\left( x^{2} +3\\right)}{\\left( x^{2} +3\\right)^{4}}\\\\\n& \\\\\n& =\\frac{3\\left( 1-x^{2}\\right)}{\\left( x^{2} +3\\right)^{3}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nWe see that \\(\\displaystyle x=\\pm 1\\) correspond to critical points. We can also see that:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ng^{\\prime }( x) \\ \\text{is} \\ \\begin{cases}\n&lt; 0, & x&lt; -1\\\\\n=0, & x=-1\\\\\n&gt;0, & -1&lt; x&lt; 1\\\\\n=0, & x=1\\\\\n&lt; 0, & x &gt;1\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nThis suggests that \\(\\displaystyle g\\) decreases from \\(\\displaystyle -\\infty\\) to \\(\\displaystyle -1\\), reaches a local minimum at \\(\\displaystyle x=-1\\), then increases from \\(\\displaystyle -1\\) to \\(\\displaystyle 1\\), reaches a local maximum at \\(\\displaystyle x=1\\) and then decreases from \\(\\displaystyle 1\\) to \\(\\displaystyle \\infty\\). This along with the fact that the x-axis is an asymptote to \\(\\displaystyle g\\) suggests that \\(\\displaystyle x=-1\\) has to be a global minimum and \\(\\displaystyle x=1\\) has to be a global maximum. We have reached the following conclusion:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\ng( x) \\geqslant g( 1) =\\frac{1}{16}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nPlugging this back into \\(\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }( x)\\), we see that:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nc &gt;\\frac{1}{8} \\Longrightarrow f^{\\prime }( x)  &gt;0,\\ \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]",
