- Ramya and Josephine were once close friends; but now, they are not.
  - There is no way of concluding this. Ramya and Josephine could be colleagues. Or they may still be close friends, but Ramya could have had some other engagement when Josephine was at the hospital.
- Josephine was in the hospital due to an injury to her leg.
  - We know that Josephine was in the hospital. But she could have been there for any number of reasons. This is one among many possibilities.
- Ramya knew that Josephine was in the hospital.
  - Ramya didn't know that Josephine was in the hospital initially. But she subsequently got to know this information, either from Josephine herself or from some other source.
- Ramya did not know that Josephine was in the hospital.
  - This is what we can conclude. The key phrase is "even if I had known". It is clear from this that she didn't have this information at a certain point in time.
