In the sequence 6, 9, 14, x, 30, 41, a possible value of x is

- [ ] 25
- [ ] 21
- [ ] 18
- [ ] 20

One possibility is to have the successive difference between be an arithmetic progression with first term $\displaystyle 3$ and common difference $\displaystyle 2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
9-6 & =3 & \\
14-9 & =5 & \\
x-14 & =7 & \Longrightarrow x=21\\
30-21 & =9 & \\
41-30 & =11 & 
\end{aligned}
$$
