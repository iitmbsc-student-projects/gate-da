Let the number of coins of the three denominations be $\displaystyle 5k$, $\displaystyle 3k$ and $\displaystyle 13k$. The total money in the person's possession is $\displaystyle 5k\times 1+3k\times 5+13k\times 10=150k$. The percentage of money in ₹5 coins is $\displaystyle \frac{3k\times 5}{150k} \times 100=10\%$.
