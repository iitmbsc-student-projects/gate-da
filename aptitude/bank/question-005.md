Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote two arbitrary prime numbers. Which one of the following statements is correct for all values of $p_1$ and $p_2$?

- [ ] $p_1 + p_2$ is not a prime number
- [ ] $p_1p_2$ is not a prime number
- [ ] $p_1 + p_2 + 1$ is a prime number
- [ ] $p_1p_2 + 1$ is a prime number

- [ ] $p_1 + p_2$ is not a prime number
- [x] $p_1p_2$ is not a prime number
- [ ] $p_1 + p_2 + 1$ is a prime number
- [ ] $p_1p_2 + 1$ is a prime number

- If $\displaystyle p_{1} =2,p_{2} =7$, then $\displaystyle p_{1} +p_{2} =9$ is not prime. However, if $\displaystyle p_{2} =2,p_{2} =3$, then $\displaystyle p_{1} +p_{2} =5$ is a prime.

- $\displaystyle p_{1} p_{2}$ has two prime factors other than itself and $\displaystyle 1$. Hence $\displaystyle p_{1} p_{2}$ is not prime for all primes $\displaystyle p_{1}$ and $\displaystyle p_{2}$.

- If $\displaystyle p_{1} =2,p_{2} =3$, then $\displaystyle p_{1} +p_{2} +1=6$ is not a prime.

- If $\displaystyle p_{1} =3,p_{2} =5$, then $\displaystyle p_{1} p_{2} +1=16$ is not a prime.
