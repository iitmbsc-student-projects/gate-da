Consider the following sample of numbers:

9, 18, 11, 14, 15, 17, 10, 69, 11, 13

The median of the sample is

- [ ] 14
- [ ] 13.5
- [ ] 11
- [ ] 18.7

- [ ] 14
- [x] 13.5
- [ ] 11
- [ ] 18.7

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Soluton" collapse=true}

The sorted list is:

```
[9, 10, 11, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 69]
```

Since there are an even number of elements, the median is $\cfrac{13 + 14}{2} = 13.5$.
