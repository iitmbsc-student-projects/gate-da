Two wizards try to create a spell using all the four elements, *water*, *air*, *fire*, and *earth*. For this, they decide to mix all these elements in all possible orders. They also decide to work independently. After trying all possible combination of elements, they conclude that the spell does not work.

How many attempts does each wizard make before coming to this conclusion, independently?

Since all the four elements have to be used, we need to look at the number of ways of arranging the four elements in any order. This is $4! = 24$.
