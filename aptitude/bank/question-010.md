The diagram below shows a river system consisting of 7 segments, marked P, Q, R,
S, T, U, and V. It splits the land into 5 zones, marked Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, and Z5. We
need to connect these zones using the least number of bridges. Out of the following options, which one is correct?

Note: The figure shown is representative.

- We need at least one bridge to connect Z4 with the other zones. So a bridge on U or V is mandatory. This eliminates the first two options.

- Between the last two options, we evaluate the first one to see if we can get away with 4 bridges. This is indeed the case.
