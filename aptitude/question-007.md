If IMAGE and FIELD are coded as FHBNJ and EMFJG respectively, which one among the following options is the most appropriate for BEACH?

- [ ] CEADP
- [ ] IDBFC
- [ ] JGIBC
- [ ] IBCEC

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse=true}

- [ ] CEADP
- [x] IDBFC
- [ ] JGIBC
- [ ] IBCEC

::: {.callout-note title="Soluton" collapse=true}

We have:

```
IMAGE
FHBNJ
```

```
FIELD
EMFJG
```

Staring at this for a while should convince us that the following transformation converts a word into its code:

- Reverse the word
- Increment each letter

We have:

- IMAGE $\rightarrow$ EGAMI $\rightarrow$ FHBNJ
- FIELD $\rightarrow$ DLEIF $\rightarrow$ EMFJG

Once this is clear, we can apply the same transformation to BEACH.

BEACH $\rightarrow$ HCAEB $\rightarrow$ IDBFC
