In the diagram, the lines QR and ST are parallel to each other.
The shortest distance between these two lines is half the shortest distance between the point P and line QR.

Drop a perpendicular from $P$ to $QR$. Let it intersect $ST$ and $QR$ at $U$ and $V$ respectively.

We are given that $UV = \cfrac{PV}{2}$. This leaves us with $PU = UV$. Since $\Delta PST$ and $\Delta PQR$ are similar, and since $PU = \cfrac{PV}{2}$, the area of $\Delta PST$ is one-fourth that of $\Delta PQR$. The area of the trapezium $SQRT$ is three-fourth that of $\Delta PQR$. The required ratio is $\cfrac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \cfrac{1}{3}$.
