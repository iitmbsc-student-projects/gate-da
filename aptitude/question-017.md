A person sold two different items at the same price. He made 10% profit in one item, and 10% loss in the other item.

In selling these two items, the person made a total of

Let $\displaystyle x$ and $\displaystyle y$ be the cost prices of the two items. With the given information, their selling prices are $\displaystyle 1.1x$ and $\displaystyle 0.9y$ respectively. Since they are equal, let:

\begin{equation*}
1.1x=0.9y=p
\end{equation*}

Now, the profit percentage on selling both together is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{( 1.1x+0.9y) -( x+y)}{x+y} \times 100 & =\frac{0.1x-0.1y}{x+y} \times 100\\\\
 & =\frac{\frac{p}{1.1} -\frac{p}{0.9}}{\frac{p}{1.1} +\frac{p}{0.9}} \times 10\\\\
 & =-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, there is a loss of $\displaystyle 1\%$.
