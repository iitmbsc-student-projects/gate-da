In the given figure, $PQRS$ is a square of side $2$ cm and $PLMN$ is a rectangle. The corner $L$ of the rectangle is on the side $QR$. Side $MN$ of the rectangle passes through the corner $S$ of the square.

What is the area (in cm²) of the rectangle $PLMN$?

A bit of angle chasing gives us the following:

Now, using a bit of trigonometry, we see the following:

$$
PL = \cfrac{2}{\sin(\theta)}, PN = 2 \sin(\theta)
$$

Therefore, the area of the rectangle $PLMN$ is $4$.
