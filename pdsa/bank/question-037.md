What is recurrence and time complexity for **worst case** of **Merge Sort** ? 

- [ ] Recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)$ and time complexity is $O(n^2)$
- [ ] Recurrence is $T(n) = T(n/2) + O(n)$ and time complexity is $O(n^2)$
- [ ] Recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)$ and time complexity is $O(n\log n)$
- [ ] Recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1)$ and time complexity is $O(n\log n)$
