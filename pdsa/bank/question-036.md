A list of `n` strings, each of length `n` is sorted in `lexicographical order` using the Merge Sort algorithm. What is its time complexity? 

Assume that comparing strings lexicographically takes $O(n)$. 

- [ ] $O(n\log n)$
- [ ] $O(n^2\log n)$
- [ ] $O(n^2)$
- [ ] $O(\log n)$

- [ ] $O(n\log n)$
- [x] $O(n^2\log n)$
- [ ] $O(n^2)$
- [ ] $O(\log n)$
