A list of `n` strings, each of length `n` is sorted in `lexicographical order` using the Merge Sort algorithm. What is its time complexity? (Assume that comparing strings lexicographically takes $O(n)$) 

- [ ] $O(nlogn)$
- [ ] $O(n^2logn)$
- [ ] $O(n^2)$
- [ ] $O(logn)$

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse=true}

- [ ] $O(nlogn)$
- [x] $O(n^2logn)$
- [ ] $O(n^2)$
- [ ] $O(logn)$
