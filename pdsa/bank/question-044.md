Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph. Given a source vertex $s$, for $x ∈ V$, let $d(x)$ denote the shortest distance in $G$ from $s$ to $x$. A breadth first search (BFS) is performed starting at $s$. Let $T$ be the resultant BFS tree. If $(u, v)$ is an edge of $G$ that is not in $T$, then which one of the following **cannot** be the value of $d(u)−d(v)$?
