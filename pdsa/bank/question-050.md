Suppose we run Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm on a graph `G` which have edges with distinct weights and these two algorithms produce minimum-cost spanning trees $T_P$ and $T_K$, with total minimum cost $C_p$ and $C_k$ respectively. Which of the following is **true**? 

- [ ] $T_P$ and $T_K$  are always the same  but $C_p$ may not be equal to $C_k$
- [ ] $T_P$ may be different to $T_K$ but $C_p$ is always equal to $C_k$
- [ ] $T_P$ and $T_K$  are always the same and $C_p$ is always equal to $C_k$
- [ ] $T_P$ may be different to $T_K$ and $C_p$ may not be equal to $C_k$

- [ ] $T_P$ and $T_K$  are always the same  but $C_p$ may not be equal to $C_k$
- [ ] $T_P$ may be different to $T_K$ but $C_p$ is always equal to $C_k$
- [x] $T_P$ and $T_K$  are always the same and $C_p$ is always equal to $C_k$
- [ ] $T_P$ may be different to $T_K$ and $C_p$ may not be equal to $C_k$
