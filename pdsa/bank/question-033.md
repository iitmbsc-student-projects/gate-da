Let $g(n) = 6n^4 + 20n^3$ and $f(n) = 5762n^3\log{n} + 436n^2$. Which of the following is true?

- [ ] $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ and $g(n)$ is $O(f(n))$
- [ ] $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$, but $g(n)$ is not $O(f(n))$
- [ ] $f(n)$ is not $O(g(n))$ and $g(n)$ is not $O(f(n))$
- [ ] $g(n)$ is $O(f(n))$, but $f(n)$ is not $O(g(n))$

- [ ] $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ and $g(n)$ is $O(f(n))$
- [x] $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$, but $g(n)$ is not $O(f(n))$
- [ ] $f(n)$ is not $O(g(n))$ and $g(n)$ is not $O(f(n))$
- [ ] $g(n)$ is $O(f(n))$, but $f(n)$ is not $O(g(n))$
