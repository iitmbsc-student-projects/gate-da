Consider an undirected graph G. Let T be a depth first search traversal tree. Let `u` be a vertex in G and let `v` be the next visited vertex after visiting `u` in the traversal. Which of the following statements is always **true** ? 

- [ ] (u, v) must be an edge in G, and `u` is a descendant of `v` in T
- [ ] (u, v) must be an edge in G and `v` is a descendant of `u` in T
- [ ] If (u, v) is not an edge in G then `u` is a leaf in T
- [ ] If (u, v) is not an edge in G then `u` and `v` must have the same parent in T

- [ ] (u, v) must be an edge in G, and `u` is a descendant of `v` in T
- [ ] (u, v) must be an edge in G and `v` is a descendant of `u` in T
- [x] If (u, v) is not an edge in G then `u` is a leaf in T
- [ ] If (u, v) is not an edge in G then `u` and `v` must have the same parent in T
