Consider a weighted, directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E, w)$ in which edges that leave the source vertex $s$ may have negative weights and all other edges weights are non-negative.

Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?

1. Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly computes the shortest-path weight $δ(s, t)$ from $s$ to every vertex $t$ in this graph G.

2. Dijkstra’s algorithm may compute an incorrect shortest-path weight $δ(s, t)$ from $s$ to at least one vertex $t$ in this graph G.

3. Bellman's Ford algorithm correctly computes the shortest-path weight $δ(s, t)$ from $s$ to every vertex $t$ in this graph G.
