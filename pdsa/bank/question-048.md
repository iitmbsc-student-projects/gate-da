Consider a complete undirected graph with vertex set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Every entry `W[i][j]` where $i \ne j$ in the matrix `W` below is the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

$$
W=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 8 & 1 & 4\\1 & 0 & 12 & 4 & 9\\8 & 12 & 0 & 7 & 3\\1 & 4 & 7 & 0 & 2\\4 & 9 & 3 & 2 & 0\end{bmatrix}
$$
What is the minimum possible weight of a path `P` from vertex `4` to vertex `1` in this graph?
