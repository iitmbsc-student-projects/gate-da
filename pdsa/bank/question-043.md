A kingâ€™s summer house is being rewired. The house has 11 rooms. To avoid wires getting entangled and creating short circuits, the electricians have been asked to observe the following rules. 

* Room 1 must be rewired before rooms 3 and 4. 
* Room 2 must be rewired before room 6. 
* Room 3 must be rewired before room 5. 
* Room 5 must be rewired before rooms 8 and 9. 
* Room 6 must be rewired before room 7. 
* Room 7 must be rewired before room 5. 
* Room 8 must be rewired before room 10. 
* Room 9 must be rewired before room 11. 

It takes one full day to rewire a room. There are enough electricians to rewire as many rooms as can be rewired in parallel, keeping in mind the constraints above. 

What is the minimum number of days required to complete the job?
