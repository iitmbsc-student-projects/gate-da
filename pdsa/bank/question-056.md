If we perform the following operations on the max heap [30, 20, 25, 5, 15, 23, 10, 3, 2] then the resulting max heap would be:

```python
delete_max()
insert(24)
delete_max()
```

- [ ] [24, 20, 5, 15, 23, 10, 3, 2]
- [ ] [24, 23, 20, 5, 15, 2, 10, 3]
- [ ] [24, 20, 23, 5, 15, 2, 10, 3]
- [ ] [24, 20, 23, 15, 10, 2, 5, 3]
