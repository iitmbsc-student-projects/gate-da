Consider an undirected connected graph $G$ with $V$ vertices, where all edge costs are distinct. Which of the following statement(s) is/are **true**?

1. Let $V$ be partitioned into two non-empty sets $X$ and $Y$. Let $e = (s, t)$ be the minimum cost edge, with $s$ belonging to $X$ and $t$ belonging to $Y$. Then edge $e$ must definitely belong to the minimum cost spanning tree of $G$.
2. Let $C$ be any cycle in $G$, and let edge $e = (u, v)$ be the most expensive edge belonging to $C$. Then edge $e$ does not belong to the minimum spanning tree of $G$.
