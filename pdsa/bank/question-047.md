An undirected graph $G$ has 19 vertices. The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in $G$ is $d$. The number of vertices of odd degree in $G$ is $k$, Which of these values are possible for $d$ and $k$ ? 

- [ ] $d$ = 66, $k$ = 9 
- [ ] $d$ = 63, $k$ = 9 
- [ ] $d$ = 66, $k$ = 8 
- [ ] $d$ = 63, $k$ = 8

- [ ] $d$ = 63, $k$ = 9 
- [x] $d$ = 66, $k$ = 8 
- [ ] $d$ = 63, $k$ = 8
